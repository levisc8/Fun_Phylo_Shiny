# Shiny app for functional-phylogenetic distance analysis

This repository hosts the development version of the code used to power the shiny app used to analyze the functional-phylogenetic-demographic models in my MSc. thesis and (hopefully) subsequent publication. Currently, it supports playing with the data included in the [`FunPhylo`](https://github.com/levisc8/Fun_Phylo_Package) package.

You can view the app [here](https://sam-levin.shinyapps.io/Invasives_FPD/). Further improvements will be published as they complete testing. Please file any bug reports in the _Issues_ section of this repo. Enjoy!
