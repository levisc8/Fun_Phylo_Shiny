This app employs the methods described by Cadotte et al 2013 and used in Thorn et al 2015 and other recent publications to demonstrate how the relationship between novelty and invasiveness is mediated by competition. The goal here is to create an interactive version of this analysis that allows a user to explore how relationships can change when incorporating information on both phylogeny and functional traits. Future directions include generalizing this app so other users can put in their own data and phylogeny and conduct analyses using this interactive platform.

The app works for nearly all combinations of traits, though a few will return errors as there are too many missing values in the underlying data to calculate a meaningful distance measure. Generally, errors including `NA/NaN/Inf in x` indicate that this combination of traits cannot be calculated due to missing data. Please report any other errors [here](https://github.com/levisc8/Fun_Phylo_Shiny/issues) and include the settings you had for each menu item in the report. The app is powered by `Shiny` and depends heavily on a package called `FunPhylo`. The package is not hosted on _CRAN_, but the source code for both are publicly available on my GitHub page ([package](https://github.com/levisc8/Fun_Phylo_Package), [app](https://github.com/levisc8/Fun_Phylo_Shiny)).

The `Plot Type` dropdown controls the type of plot you will see. `GLM` plots effect size of competition or invasive status vs your selected novelty metric. The explanatory variable is calculated based on the traits you've selected and the phylogenetic scaling parameter (1 = all phylogenetic information, 0 = all functional trait information). `Explanatory power` will generate a figure showing you the explanatory power of the linear models from the `GLM` option as a function of the phylogenetic scaling parameter. Note that the UI changes a bit here, as some of the options are no longer relevant. Finally, please be patient with `Explanatory power` when the scale is set to `Local`. It has a lot of calculations to do and it may take a second or two to load! You can reduce waiting times by reducing the resolution for the phylogenetic scaling parameter.

Note that whenever `Scale` is set to `Local`, herbaceous focal species will only be compared to other herbaceous species in its community, and the same applies to the woody focal species. This is not the case for `Regional` settings.  I will likely add an option to change this, but it's staying for now.

Additionally, some communities had few members with overlapping trait data. For example, some of the species might have plant height data, but no data on SLA or toughness. In this case, the underlying code returns `NA`. I've set it to impute mean distances from the community wide matrix in these cases as this is a general way of dealing with missing data that doesn't impose the analytical constraints that phylogenetic imputation methods might. The app should return a warning if this is the case. 

Finally, `Growth Form` corresponds to a suite of dummy variables which include woody status, type of plant (See Perez-Harguindeguy 2013), and N fixation. `Dispersal Mechanism` includes information on predominant means of sexual reproduction and whether or not the species is clonal. `Flower Period` is based on the beginning of flowering in Missouri.
