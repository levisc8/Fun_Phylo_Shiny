# Shiny app for functional-phylogenetic distance analysis

This repository hosts the development version of the code used to power the shiny app described in Levin et al 2017 (or 2018). Currently, it supports playing with the data included in the `FunPhylo` package. Hopefully, I will have the time to generalize it for other data sets in the not so distant future. 

You can view the app [here](https://sam-levin.shinyapps.io/Invasives_FPD/). Further improvements will be published as they complete testing. Please file any bug reports in the _Issues_ section of this repo. Enjoy!
