# Shiny app for functional-phylogenetic distance analysis

This repository hosts the development version of the code used to power the shiny app described in Levin et al 2017 (or 2018). The version currently works for some features, but is still far from where I'd like it to be. 

The app is now live! You can view it [here](https://sam-levin.shinyapps.io/Invasives_FPD/). Improvements will be published as they complete testing.
